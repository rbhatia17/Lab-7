# Lab-7

# Critique of Lab session 3

The lab session i submitted last time showed a visualization for nintendo where they had a security breach in 2011 and the stock price also went down. But we can't be sure that was it only because of the security breach or was there any other reason behind this. The visualization i submitted was a MVP but not the complete product. If i look at it for the first time my reaction would be does this support the claim that financial markets punish security breaches, As there is no visualization to present that there was a security breach which took place at the time of the stock prices going down. It can also be an exception, we cant say from one company's data that its the trend. To have a trend we need to have analysis for more companies and if the same thing happens in all the comapnies only then we can say its a trend. 

# Enhance my lab session

To enhance and improve my previous visualization i would like to be more specific with my visualization and that would be:
1. First i would explore my data, does all the companies data that i have support this claim, as we know the recent security breach took place in Equifax and for that also the prices did go down but want to analyze my other companies also that does it  support my claim. Does it match with other companies record lost and the stock price going down. So basically i would like to compare the stock prices going down with other data that is number of records lost, number of breaches over year. 
2. Then i would find the warrants for my claim and explain them in detail with the claim i choose according the data. 
3. If there is a Rebuttal i would find that. 
4. I would like to analyze more on my perception that are the stock prices and comprehension to it is does the number of records lost change with the stock prices. Relation between the stock prices and the records lost would actually enhance my analysis and will help to do a correct analysis and see the trend. 

Rebuttal to my claim:

This is the stock price for adobe but adobe had a security breach in 2013 and its stock price went up after that so its a rebuttal to my claim. 
So i would do more analysis over this.
